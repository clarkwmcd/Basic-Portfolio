			<p>
				Professional Fullstack Developer located in Portsmouth, NH. I am fluent in HTML and CSS. My previous professional career has been as a mechanical engineer for US Navy submarines. I received a degree in mechanical engineering with a minor in renewable energy engineering from the University of Maine in 2015.

			<p>
				I enjoy living in the seacoast area and everything it has to offer. In the Winter I enjoy snowboarding in the mountains. In the Fall, Summer and Spring I enjoy heading to the beach or you can usually find me mountain biking with friends after work.
